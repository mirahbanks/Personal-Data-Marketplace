# Decentralized Personal Data Marketplace (DataDAO)

A blockchain-based platform enabling individuals to securely monetize their personal data while maintaining control over privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Overview

DataDAO revolutionizes personal data management by creating a secure marketplace where individuals can tokenize, control, and monetize their personal data. The platform ensures privacy, regulatory compliance, and fair compensation while giving users complete sovereignty over their information.

## Core Components

### Data Ownership Contract

The Data Ownership Contract manages personal data sovereignty:

- Data tokenization and verification
- Identity verification system
- Data encryption management
- Revocation capabilities
- Version control
- Data update mechanisms
- Historical tracking
- Inheritance protocols

### Data Access Contract

The Data Access Contract controls data accessibility:

- Permission management
- Access level definitions
- Time-bound access grants
- Usage tracking
- Audit logging
- Data request processing
- Access revocation
- Emergency shutdown procedures

### Pricing Contract

The Pricing Contract determines data valuation:

- Dynamic pricing algorithms
- Market demand analysis
- Data quality assessment
- Usage rights pricing
- Bundle pricing
- Time-based pricing
- Volume discounts
- Revenue optimization

### Compliance Contract

The Compliance Contract ensures regulatory adherence:

- GDPR compliance verification
- CCPA compliance checking
- Data retention management
- Right to be forgotten
- Data portability
- Consent management
- Regulatory reporting
- Cross-border transfers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet with sufficient ETH

- Node.js v16.0.0 or higher
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Compatible encryption tools
- KYC verification

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-dao.git
cd data-dao
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Deploy contracts:

```

## Usage

### Registering Personal Data

```javascript
const dataOwnership = await DataOwnershipContract.deploy();
await dataOwnership.registerData(
    dataType,
    encryptedData,
    accessPolicy,
    complianceMetadata
);
```

### Managing Access Permissions

```javascript
const dataAccess = await DataAccessContract.deploy();
await dataAccess.grantAccess(
    dataId,
    requesterAddress,
    accessLevel,
    duration,
    terms
);
```

### Setting Data Pricing

```javascript
const pricing = await PricingContract.deploy();
await pricing.setPricing(
    dataId,
    basePrice,
    usageRights,
    discountRules
);
```
